# TCP / IP

**TCP/IP** model by **DARPA** *(Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)*.
**OSi** *(open systems interconnection)* model by **ISO** *(international standards organization)*.


**RFC** *(request for comment)* documents define protocols.
**RFC** does not redefine already defined protocols. (ie, **RFC** just references the LAN definition by **IEEE**)

> TCP/IP model is considered the more practical model of the two.

TCP provides error recovery services.

4 steps of data transmission.

1. Encapsulation
2. Transmission
3. Recieving
4. De-Encapsulation

## Encapsulation

Data is encapsulated on each layer.

> Encapsulation standards in the OSi model is different than that of TCP/IP.
